 abstract = {In computer simulations of solvation effects on chemical
reactions, continuum modeling techniques regain popularity as a
way to efficiently circumvent an otherwise costly sampling of
solvent degrees of freedom. As effective techniques, such
implicit solvation models always depend on a number of
parameters that need to be determined earlier. In the past, the
focus lay mostly on an accurate parametrization of water models.
Yet, non-aqueous solvents have recently attracted increasing
attention, in particular, for the design of battery materials.
To this end, we present a systematic parametrization protocol
for the Self-Consistent Continuum Solvation (SCCS) model
resulting in optimized parameters for 67 non-aqueous solvents.
Our parametrization is based on a collection of $â‰ˆ$6000
experimentally measured partition coefficients, which we
collected in the Solv@TUM database presented here. The accuracy
of our optimized SCCS model is comparable to the well-known
universal continuum solvation model (SMx) family of methods,
while relying on only a single fit parameter and thereby largely
reducing statistical noise. Furthermore, slightly modifying the
non-electrostatic terms of the model, we present the SCCS-P
solvation model as a more accurate alternative, in particular,
for aromatic solutes. Finally, we show that SCCS parameters can,
to a good degree of accuracy, also be predicted for solvents
outside the database using merely the dielectric bulk
permittivity of the solvent of choice.},
