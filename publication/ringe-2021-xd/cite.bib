 abstract = {Implicit solvation is an effective, highly coarse-grained
approach in atomic-scale simulations to account for a surrounding
liquid electrolyte on the level of a continuous polarizable
medium. Originating in molecular chemistry with finite solutes,
implicit solvation techniques are now increasingly used in the
context of first-principles modeling of electrochemistry and
electrocatalysis at extended (often metallic) electrodes. The
prevalent ansatz to model the latter electrodes and the reactive
surface chemistry at them through slabs in periodic boundary
condition supercells brings its specific challenges. Foremost
this concerns the difficulty of describing the entire double
layer forming at the electrified solid-liquid interface (SLI)
within supercell sizes tractable by commonly employed density
functional theory (DFT). We review liquid solvation methodology
from this specific application angle, highlighting in particular
its use in the widespread ab initio thermodynamics approach to
surface catalysis. Notably, implicit solvation can be employed to
mimic a polarization of the electrode's electronic density under
the applied potential and the concomitant capacitive charging of
the entire double layer beyond the limitations of the employed
DFT supercell. Most critical for continuing advances of this
effective methodology for the SLI context is the lack of
pertinent (experimental or high-level theoretical) reference data
needed for parametrization.},
