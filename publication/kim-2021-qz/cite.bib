 abstract = {Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction
(CO2RR) is a promising approach to mitigate CO2 concentration
and generate carbon feedstock. Recently, the (sub-)nanometer
design of catalyst structures has been revealed as an efficient
means to control the reaction process through the local reaction
environment. Herein, the synthesis of a novel tin oxide (SnOx)
nanoparticle (NP) catalyst with highly controlled sub-nanoscale
interplanar gaps of widths <1 nm (SnOx NP-s) is reported via the
lithium electrochemical tuning (LiET) method. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and 3D-tomo-scanning TEM (STEM)
analysis confirm the presence of a distinct segmentation pattern
and the newly engineered interparticle confined space in the
SnOx NP-s. The catalyst exhibits a significant increase in CO2RR
versus hydrogen evolution selectivity by a factor of $≈$5
with 20% higher formate selectivity relative to pristine SnO2
NPs at ?1.2 VRHE. Density functional theory calculations and
cation-size-dependent experiments indicate that this is
attributable to a gap-stabilization of the rate-limiting *OCHO
and *COOH intermediates, the formation of which is driven by the
interfacial electric field. Moreover, the SnOx NP-s exhibits
stable performance during CO2RR over 50 h. These results
highlight the potential of controlled atomic spaces in directing
electrochemical reaction selectivity and the design of highly
optimized catalytic materials.},
