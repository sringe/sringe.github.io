 abstract = {Electrochemical two-electron water oxidation is a promising route
for renewable and on-site H2O2 generation as an alternative to
the anthraquinone process. However, it is currently restricted by
low selectivity due to strong competition from the traditional
four-electron oxygen evolution reaction, as well as large
overpotential and low production rates. Here we report an
interfacial engineering approach, where by coating the catalyst
with hydrophobic polymers we confine in situ produced O2 gas to
tune the water oxidation reaction pathway. Using carbon catalysts
as a model system, we show a significant increase of the
intrinsic H2O-to-H2O2 selectivity and activity compared to that
of the pristine catalyst. The maximal H2O2 Faradaic efficiency
was enhanced by sixfold to 66% with an overpotential of 640 mV,
under which a H2O2 production rate of 23.4 µmol min−1 cm−2 (75.2
mA cm−2 partial current) was achieved. This approach was
successfully extended to nickel metal, demonstrating the wide
applicability of our local gas confinement concept.},
