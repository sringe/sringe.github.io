 abstract = {Solid--liquid interface engineering has recently emerged as a
promising technique to optimize the activity and product
selectivity of the electrochemical reduction of CO2. In
particular, the cation identity and the interfacial electric
field have been shown to have a particularly significant impact
on the activity of desired products. Using a combination of
theoretical and experimental investigations, we show the cation
size and its resultant impact on the interfacial electric field
to be the critical factor behind the ion specificity of
electrochemical CO2 reduction. We present a multi-scale modeling
approach that combines size-modified Poisson--Boltzmann theory
with ab initio simulations of field effects on critical reaction
intermediates. The model shows an unprecedented quantitative
agreement with experimental trends in cation effects on CO
production on Ag, C2 production on Cu, CO vibrational signatures
on Pt and Cu as well as Au(111) single crystal experimental
double layer capacitances. The insights obtained represent
quantitative evidence for the impact of cations on the
interfacial electric field. Finally, we present design
principles to increase the activity and selectivity of any
field-sensitive electrochemical process based on the surface
charging properties: the potential of zero charge, the ion size,
and the double layer capacitance.},
