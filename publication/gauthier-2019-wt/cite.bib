 abstract = {A major challenge in the modeling of electrochemical phenomena
is the accurate description of the interface between an
electrolyte and a charged conductor. Polarizable continuum
models (PCM) have been gaining popularity because they offer a
computationally inexpensive method of modeling the electrolyte.
In this Perspective, we discuss challenges from using one such
model which treats the ions using a linearized
Poisson--Boltzmann (LPB) distribution. From a physical
perspective, this model places charge unphysically close to the
surface and adsorbates, and it includes excessively steep
ramping of the dielectric constant from the surface to the bulk
solvent. Both of these issues can be somewhat mitigated by
adjusting parameters built into the model, but in doing so, the
resultant capacitance deviates from experimental values.
Likewise, hybrid explicit-implicit approaches to the solvent may
offer a more realistic description of hydrogen bonding and
solvation to reaction intermediates, but the corresponding
capacitances also deviate from experimental values. These
deviations highlight the need for a careful adjustment of
parameters in order to reproduce not only solvation energies but
also other physical properties of solid--liquid interfaces.
Continuum approaches alone also necessarily do not capture local
variations in the electric field from cations at the interface,
which can affect the energetics of intermediates with
substantial dipoles or polarizability. Finally, since the
double-layer charge can be varied continuously, LPB/PCM models
provide a way to determine electrochemical barriers at constant
potential. However, double-layer charging and the atomic motion
associated with reaction events occur on significantly different
timescales. We suggest that more detailed approaches, such as
the modified Poisson--Boltzmann model and/or the addition of a
Stern layer, may be able to mitigate some but not all of the
challenges discussed.},
