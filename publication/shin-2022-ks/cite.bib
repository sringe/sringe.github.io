 abstract = {To design electrochemical interfaces for efficient
electric-chemical energy interconversion, it is critical to
reveal the electric double layer (EDL) structure and relate it
with electrochemical activity; nonetheless, this has been a
long-standing challenge. Of particular, no molecular-level
theories have fully explained the characteristic two peaks
arising in the potential-dependence of the EDL capacitance, which
is sensitively dependent on the EDL structure. We herein
demonstrate that our first-principles-based molecular simulation
reproduces the experimental capacitance peaks. The origin of two
peaks emerging at anodic and cathodic potentials is unveiled to
be an electrosorption of ions and a structural phase transition,
respectively. We further find a cation complexation gradually
modifies the EDL structure and the field strength, which linearly
scales the carbon dioxide reduction activity. This study
deciphers the complex structural response of the EDL and
highlights its catalytic importance, which bridges the
mechanistic gap between the EDL structure and electrocatalysis.},
