 abstract = {Single-atom catalysts have recently emerged as promising
low-cost alternatives to Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR). Given the unique properties that distinguish these
systems from traditional transition-metal electrocatalysts, it
is essential to benchmark and establish appropriate
computational approaches to study these novel materials. Herein,
we employ multiple levels of theory, including wave function
methods, density functional theory (DFT), and classical
simulations, to investigate Cu-modified covalent triazine
framework catalysts (Cu/CTF). We consider three major aspects of
treating this system computationally. First, we present a
step-wise approach to predict the ORR mechanism and adsorbate
coverages on Cu/CTF. We then benchmark various DFT methods to
coupled-cluster theory with the domain-based local pair natural
orbital approximation, which indicates that HSE06 and PBE0
hybrid functionals most accurately describe the adsorption
energies of ORR adsorbates on Cu/CTF. We finally employ
thermodynamic integration and other techniques to consider
solvation effects, which play significant roles in predicting
the energies of reaction intermediates and the overall ORR
pathway. Our findings indicate that accurate descriptions of
both the electronic structure and solvation are necessary to
understand the ORR activity of Cu/CTF.},
