 abstract = {Over the last years, the development of highly active and
durable Pt-based electrocatalysts has been identified as the
main target for a large-scale industrial application of fuel
cells. In this work, we make a significant step ahead in this
direction by preparing a high-performance electrocatalyst and
suggesting new structure--activity design concepts which could
shape the future of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst
design. For this, we present a new one-dimensional nanowire
catalyst consisting of a L10 ordered intermetallic PtCo alloy
core and compressively strained high-index facets in the Pt-rich
shell. We find the nanoscale PtCo catalyst to provide an
excellent turnover for the ORR and hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER), which we explain from high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations
to be due to the high ratio of Pt(221) facets. These facets
include highly active ORR and HER sites surprisingly on the
terraces which are activated by a combination of sub-surface
Co-induced high Miller index-related strain and oxygen coverage
on the step sites. The low dimensionality of the catalyst
provides a cost-efficient use of Pt. In addition, the high
catalytic activity and durability are found during both
half-cell and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)
operations for both ORR and HER. We believe the revealed design
concepts for generating active sites on the Pt-based catalyst
can open up a new pathway toward the development of
high-performance cathode catalysts for PEMFCs and other
catalytic systems.},
