 abstract = {Electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction is a potential route to
the sustainable production of valuable fuels and chemicals.
Here, we perform CO<sub>2</sub> reduction experiments on Gold at
neutral to acidic pH values to elucidate the long-standing
controversy surrounding the rate-limiting step. We find the CO
production rate to be invariant with pH on a Standard Hydrogen
Electrode scale and conclude that it is limited by the
CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption step. We present a new multi-scale
modeling scheme that integrates ab initio reaction kinetics with
mass transport simulations, explicitly considering the charged
electric double layer. The model reproduces the experimental CO
polarization curve and reveals the rate-limiting step to be
*COOH to *CO at low overpotentials, CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption at
intermediate ones, and CO<sub>2</sub> mass transport at high
overpotentials. Finally, we show the Tafel slope to arise from
the electrostatic interaction between the dipole of
*CO<sub>2</sub> and the interfacial field. This work highlights
the importance of surface charging for electrochemical kinetics
and mass transport. Electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction is a potential
route to the sustainable production of valuable fuels and
chemicals. In this joint experimental-theoretical work, the
authors address the issue of the rate-limiting step on Gold and
present insights from multi-scale simulations into the
importance of the electric double layer on reaction kinetics and
mass transport.},
