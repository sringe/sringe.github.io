 abstract = {Modelling the electrolyte at the electrochemical interface
remains a major challenge in ab initio simulations of charge
transfer processes at surfaces. Recently, the development of
hybrid polarizable continuum models/ab initio models have allowed
for the treatment of solvation and electrolyte charge in a
computationally efficient way. However, challenges remain in its
application. Recent literature has reported that large cell
heights are required to reach convergence, which presents a
serious computational cost. Furthermore, calculations of reaction
energetics require costly iterations to tune the surface charge
to the desired potential. In this work, we present a simple
capacitor model of the interface that illuminates how to
circumvent both of these challenges. We derive a correction to
the energy for finite cell heights to obtain the large cell
energies at no additional computational expense. We furthermore
demonstrate that the reaction energetics determined at constant
charge are easily mapped to those at constant potential, which
eliminates the need to apply iterative schemes to tune the system
to a constant potential. These developments together represent
more than an order of magnitude reduction of the computational
overhead required for the application of polarizable continuum
models to surface electrochemistry.},
