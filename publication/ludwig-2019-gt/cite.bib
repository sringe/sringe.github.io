 abstract = {In this work, the structure of water and its interactions with
various carbon dioxide reduction intermediates adsorbed on a
Cu(211) surface is investigated using density functional theory.
We find that the presence of adsorbates has a significant and
adsorbate-specific effect on the local water structure and that
solvation can stabilize adsorbate conformations different from
those found in vacuum. We describe relationships between the
hydrogen bonding capability of an adsorbate, the dipole moment
of the adsorbate, the energetic strength of water--adsorbate
interactions, and the change induced in the local water
orientation by the adsorbate. Mechanistic implications are
discussed. We investigate and quantify the error associated with
using arbitrary locally optimized solvent structures in
calculations of relevant physical quantities, such as solvated
binding energies and work functions. Possible effects of thermal
motion on calculations of the work function are investigated
using ab initio molecular dynamics.},
