 abstract = {Implicit solvation calculations based on a Stern-layer corrected
size-modified Poisson-Boltzmann (SMPB) model are an effective
approach to capture electrolytic effects in first-principles
electronic structure calculations. For a given salt solution,
they require a range of ion-specific parameters, which describe
the size of the dissolved ions as well as thickness and shape of
the Stern layer. Out of this defined parameter space, we show
that the Stern layer thickness expressed in terms of the
solute's electron density and the resulting ionic cavity volume
completely determine ion effects on the stability of neutral
solutes. Using the efficient SMPB functionality of the
full-potential density-functional theory package FHI-aims, we
derive optimized such Stern layer parameters for neutral solutes
in various aqueous monovalent electrolytes. The parametrization
protocol relies on fitting to reference Setschenow coefficients
that describe solvation free energy changes with ionic strength
at low to medium concentrations. The availability of such data
for NaCl solutions yields a highly predictive SMPB model that
allows to recover the measured Setschenow coefficients with an
accuracy that is comparable to prevalent quantitative regression
models. Correspondingly derived SMPB parameters for other salts
suffer from a much scarcer experimental data base but lead to
Stern layer properties that follow a physically reasonable trend
with ionic hydration numbers.},
