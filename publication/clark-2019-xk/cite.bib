 abstract = {The present work was undertaken to elucidate the facet-dependent
activity of Ag for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.
To this end, CO2 reduction was investigated over Ag thin films
with (111), (100), and (110) orientations prepared via epitaxial
growth on single-crystal Si wafers with the same
crystallographic orientations. This preparation technique
yielded larger area electrodes than can be achieved using
single-crystals, which enabled the electrocatalytic activity of
the corresponding Ag surfaces to be quantified in the Tafel
regime. The Ag(110) thin films exhibited higher CO evolution
activity compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films,
consistent with previous single-crystal studies. Density
functional theory calculations suggest that CO2 reduction to CO
is strongly facet-dependent, and that steps are more active than
highly coordinated terraces. This is the result of both a higher
binding energy of the key intermediate COOH as well as an
enhanced double-layer electric field stabilization over
undercoordinated surface atoms located at step edge defects. As
a consequence, step edge defects likely dominate the CO2
reduction activity observed over the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin
films. The higher activity observed over the Ag(110) thin film
is then related to the larger density of undercoordinated sites
compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films. Our conclusion
that undercoordinated sites dominate the CO2 reduction activity
observed over close-packed surfaces highlights the need to
consider the contribution of such defects in studies of
single-crystal electrodes.},
