 abstract = {Metal oxides are a promising material for designing highly
active and selective catalysts for the electrochemical reduction
of carbon dioxide (CO2RR). Here, we designed a Cu/ceria catalyst
with high selectivity of methane production at single-atomic Cu
active sites. Using this, we report favorable design concepts
that push the product selectivity of methane formation by
combining detailed structural analysis, density functional
theory (DFT), in situ Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical
measurements. We demonstrate that a higher concentration of
oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface, resulting from more
available Cu+ sites, enables high selectivity for methane
formation during CO2RR and can be controlled by the calcination
temperature. The DFT calculation and in situ Raman studies
indicate that pH controls the surface termination; a more
alkaline pH generates hydroxylated surface motifs with more
active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction. These findings
provide insights into designing an efficient metal oxide
electrocatalyst by controlling the atomic structure via the
reaction environment and synthesis conditions.},
