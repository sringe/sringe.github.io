 abstract = {Electrochemical reduction of CO2 on copper-based catalysts has
become a promising strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions
and gain valuable chemicals and fuels. Unfortunately, however,
the generally low product selectivity of the process decreases
the industrial competitiveness compared to the established
large-scale chemical processes. Here, we present random solid
solution Cu1-xNix alloy catalysts that, due to their full
miscibility, enable a systematic modulation of adsorption
energies. In particular, we find that these catalysts lead to an
increase of hydrogen evolution with the Ni content, which
correlates with a significant increase of the selectivity for
methane formation relative to C2 products such as ethylene and
ethanol. From experimental and theoretical insights, we find the
increased hydrogen atom coverage to facilitate
Langmuir-Hinshelwood-like hydrogenation of surface
intermediates, giving an impressive almost 2 orders of magnitude
increase in the CH4 to C2H4 + C2H5OH selectivity on Cu0.87Ni0.13
at -300 mA cm-2. This study provides important insights and
design concepts for the tunability of product selectivity for
electrochemical CO2 reduction that will help to pave the way
toward industrially competitive electrocatalyst materials.},
