 abstract = {Electrocatalytic conversion of nitrogen oxides to value-added
chemicals is a promising strategy for mitigating the
human-caused unbalance of the global nitrogen-cycle, but
controlling product selectivity remains a great challenge. Here
we show iron--nitrogen-doped carbon as an efficient and durable
electrocatalyst for selective nitric oxide reduction into
hydroxylamine. Using in operando spectroscopic techniques, the
catalytic site is identified as isolated ferrous moieties, at
which the rate for hydroxylamine production increases in a
super-Nernstian way upon pH decrease. Computational multiscale
modelling attributes the origin of unconventional pH dependence
to the redox active (non-innocent) property of NO. This makes
the rate-limiting NO adsorbate state more sensitive to surface
charge which varies with the pH-dependent overpotential. Guided
by these fundamental insights, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency
of 71% and an unprecedented production rate of 215 $μ$mol
cm−2 h−1 at a short-circuit mode in a flow-type fuel cell
without significant catalytic deactivation over 50 h operation.
Electrocatalytic conversion of nitrogen oxides to value-added
chemicals is a promising strategy for mitigating the imbalance
in the global nitrogen cycle. Here, the authors present
iron--nitrogen-doped carbon as an efficient and durable
electrocatalyst for selective nitric oxide reduction to
hydroxylamine.},
