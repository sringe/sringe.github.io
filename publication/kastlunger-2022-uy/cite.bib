 abstract = {Electrochemical conversion of CO(2) into hydrocarbons and
oxygenates is envisioned as a promising path toward closing the
carbon cycle in modern technology. To date, however, the
reaction mechanisms toward the plethora of products are
disputed, complicating the search for alternative catalyst
materials. To conclusively identify the rate-limiting steps in
CO reduction on Cu, we analyzed the mechanisms on the basis of
constant-potential density functional theory (DFT) kinetics and
experiments at a wide range of pH values (3--13). We find that
*CO dimerization is energetically favored as the rate-limiting
step toward multicarbon products. This finding is consistent
with our experiments, where the reaction rate is nearly
unchanged on a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) potential
scale, even under acidic conditions. For methane, both theory
and experiments indicate a change in the rate-limiting step with
electrolyte pH from the first protonation step under
acidic/neutral conditions to a later one under alkaline
conditions. We also show, through a detailed analysis of the
microkinetics, that a surface combination of *CO and *H is
inconsistent with the measured current densities and Tafel
slopes. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
understanding for future mechanistic studies and catalyst
design.},
