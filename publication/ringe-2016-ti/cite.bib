 abstract = {The size-modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) equation is an
efficient implicit solvation model which also captures
electrolytic solvent effects. It combines an account of the
dielectric solvent response with a mean-field description of
solvated finite-sized ions. We present a general solution scheme
for the MPB equation based on a fast function-space-oriented
Newton method and a Green's function preconditioned iterative
linear solver. In contrast to popular multigrid solvers, this
approach allows us to fully exploit specialized integration
grids and optimized integration schemes. We describe a
corresponding numerically efficient implementation for the
full-potential density-functional theory (DFT) code FHI-aims. We
show that together with an additional Stern layer correction the
DFT+MPB approach can describe the mean activity coefficient of a
KCl aqueous solution over a wide range of concentrations. The
high sensitivity of the calculated activity coefficient on the
employed ionic parameters thereby suggests to use extensively
tabulated experimental activity coefficients of salt solutions
for a systematic parametrization protocol.},
