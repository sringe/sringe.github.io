 abstract = {Computational simulations have become of major interest to screen
potential photocatalysts for optimal band edge positions which
straddle the redox potentials. Unfortunately, these methods
suffer from a difficulty in resolving the dynamic solvent
response on the band edge positions. We have developed a
computational method based on the GW approximation coupled with
an implicit solvation model that solves a generalized Poisson
equation (GPE), that is, GW-GPE. Using GW-GPE, we have
investigated the band edge locations of (quasi) 2D materials
immersed in water and found a good agreement with experimental
data. We identify two contributions of the solvent effect, termed
a ''polarization-field effect'' and an ''environmental screening
effect'', which are found to be highly sensitive to the atomic
and charge distribution of the 2D materials. We believe that the
GW-GPE scheme can pave the way to predict band edge positions in
solvents, enabling design of 2D material-based photocatalysts and
energy systems.},
