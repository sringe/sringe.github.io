 abstract = {In this issue, Gao and Wang present new mechanistic insights
about the electrochemical hydrogen evolution and oxidation
reactions on Pt(111). For this they perform micro-kinetic
modeling utilizing constant potential activation barriers derived
from grand-canonical density functional theory to gain insights
on the origin of the Tafel slope, coverages, and rate-limiting
steps.},
