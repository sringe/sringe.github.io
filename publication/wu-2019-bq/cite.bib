 abstract = {A variety of methods including tuning chemical compositions,
structures, crystallinity, defects and strain, and
electrochemical intercalation have been demonstrated to enhance
the catalytic activity. However, none of these tuning methods
provide direct dynamical control during catalytic reactions. Here
we propose a new method to tune the activity of catalysts through
solid-state ion gating manipulation and adjustment (SIGMA) using
a catalysis transistor. SIGMA can electrostatically dope the
surface of catalysts with a high electron concentration over 5
$\times$ 1013 cm-2 and thus modulate both the chemical potential
of the reaction intermediates and their electrical conductivity.
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on both pristine and
defective MoS2 were investigated as model reactions. Our
theoretical and experimental results show that the overpotential
at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope can be in situ, continuously,
dynamically, and reversibly tuned over 100 mV and around 100
mV/dec, respectively.},
