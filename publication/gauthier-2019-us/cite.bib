 abstract = {One of the major open challenges in ab initio simulations of the
electrochemical interface is the determination of electrochemical
barriers under a constant driving force. Existing methods to do
so include extrapolation techniques based on fully explicit
treatments of the electrolyte, as well as implicit solvent models
which allow for a continuous variation in electrolyte charge.
Emerging hybrid continuum models have the potential to
revolutionize the field, since they account for the electrolyte
with little computational cost while retaining some explicit
electrolyte, representing a ``best of both worlds'' method. In
this work, we present a unified approach to determine reaction
energetics from fully explicit, implicit, and hybrid treatments
of the electrolyte based on a new multicapacitor model of the
electrochemical interface. A given electrode potential can be
achieved by a variety of interfacial structures; a crucial
insight from this work is that the effective surface charge gives
a good proxy of the local potential, the true driving force of
electrochemical processes. In contrast, we show that the
traditionally considered work function gives rise to multivalued
functions depending on the simulation cell size. Furthermore, we
show that the reaction energetics are largely insensitive to the
countercharge distribution chosen in hybrid implicit/explicit
models, which means that any of the myriad implicit electrolyte
models can be equivalently applied. This work thus paves the way
for the accurate treatment of ab initio reaction energetics of
general surface electrochemical processes using both implicit and
explicit electrolytes.},
