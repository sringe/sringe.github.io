 abstract = {We present a microkinetic model for CO(2) reduction (CO(2)R) on
Cu(211) towards C2 products, based on energetics estimated from
an explicit solvent model. We show that the differences in both
Tafel slopes and pH dependence for C1 vs C2 activity arise from
differences in their multi-step mechanisms. We find the depletion
in C2 products observed at high overpotential and high pH to
arise from the 2nd order dependence of C-C coupling on CO
coverage, which decreases due to competition from the C1 pathway.
We further demonstrate that CO(2) reduction at a fixed pH yield
similar activities, due to the facile kinetics for CO2 reduction
to CO on Cu, which suggests C2 products to be favored for CO2R
under alkaline conditions. The mechanistic insights of this work
elucidate how reaction conditions can lead to significant
enhancements in selectivity and activity towards higher value C2
products.},
