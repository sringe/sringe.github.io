However, the high-temperature treatment typically involved during the activation of Ni–N/C catalysts makes the origin of the high activity elusive. In this work, Ni(II) phthalocyanine molecules grafted on carbon nanotube (NiPc/CNT) and heat-treated NiPc/CNT (H-NiPc/CNT) are exploited as model catalysts to investigate the impact of thermal activation on the structure of active site and CO2RR activity. H-NiPc/CNT exhibits ~4.7-fold higher turnover frequency for CO2RR to CO in comparison to NiPc/CNT. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the heat treatment transforms molecular Ni2+–N4 sites of NiPc into Ni+–N3V (V: vacancy) and Ni+–N3 sites incorporated in the graphene lattice that concomitantly involves a breakage of Ni–N bonding, shrinkage in the Ni–N–C local structure, and decrease in the oxidation state of the Ni center from +2 to +1. DFT calculations combined with micro-kinetic modeling suggest that the Ni–N3V site appears to be responsible for the high CO2RR activity because of its lower barrier for the formation of *COOH intermediate and optimum *CO binding energy. In situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses further corroborate the importance of reduced Ni+ species in boosting the CO2RR activity.","tags":null,"title":"Thermal Transformation of Molecular Ni\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e--N\u003csub\u003e4\u003c/sub\u003e Sites for Enhanced CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e Electroreduction Activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Density functional theory calculations reveal that a strong interfacial field induced by the carbon support enhances the rate-limiting CO2 adsorption and thus CO production on Sn nanoparticles whereas the field-insensitive formate and hydrogen production routes were completely suppressed and occurred mainly from carbon sites. Modification of the interfacial electric field via exchange of the electrolyte-containing cation from Li+ to Cs+ induces an unprecedented two orders of magnitude change in the CO current, while not changing the other products. This work demonstrates how electrochemical selectivity rules can be modulated by controlling the interfacial field, thus opening up new windows for electrocatalyst design.","tags":null,"title":"Electric field mediated selectivity switching of electrochemical CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e reduction from formate to CO on carbon supported Sn","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Ringe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1589939569,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589939569,"objectID":"f82010b1eb51e2d21664628a7b5b96eb","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/software/mpbe/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T10:52:49+09:00","relpermalink":"/software/mpbe/","section":"software","summary":"Module in the all-electron DFT package FHI-aims for implicit solvent simulations including the presence of salt.","tags":[],"title":"(Size-modified) Poisson-Boltzmann implicit solvation module in FHI-aims -- (S)MPBE","type":"software"},{"authors":["Stefan Ringe","신승재\u003cbr/\u003e Seung-Jae Shin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1581558769,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581558769,"objectID":"0f639437d1e38c8492fb771d20ffd727","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/project/electrochemistrycomplexelectrifiedinterfaces/","publishdate":"2020-02-13T10:52:49+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/electrochemistrycomplexelectrifiedinterfaces/","section":"project","summary":"Accelerated quantum chemical search for the next generation of energy conversion and storage materials.","tags":[],"title":"Electrochemistry at electrified interfaces","type":"project"},{"authors":["Stefan Ringe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1581558769,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581558769,"objectID":"d0f1d6a97a18bd86a7a746c37705bb38","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/software/catint/","publishdate":"2020-02-13T10:52:49+09:00","relpermalink":"/software/catint/","section":"software","summary":"DFT and machine learning guided search for the next generation of energy conversion catalysts and storage materials.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-scale electrochemical modeling","type":"software"},{"authors":["Stefan Ringe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1581558769,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581558769,"objectID":"1f26d1e4ce90e5e9e252cb9ff9df5aa4","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/project/multiscaledesign/","publishdate":"2020-02-13T10:52:49+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/multiscaledesign/","section":"project","summary":"Optimizing energy conversion systems at multiple time and size scales, from atomic to continuum.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-scale electrochemical system design","type":"project"},{"authors":["Stefan Ringe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1581558769,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581558769,"objectID":"cf209ebb3566dbd60e3c5051e0792941","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/project_general/generalresearchgoals/","publishdate":"2020-02-13T10:52:49+09:00","relpermalink":"/project_general/generalresearchgoals/","section":"project_general","summary":"First-principles, multi-scale simulations for energy conversion and storage.","tags":[],"title":"Research interest and motivation","type":"project_general"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1581556810,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581556810,"objectID":"e957c7d6e1109b74abaf334671d8ea60","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/post/initial_post/","publishdate":"2020-02-13T10:20:10+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/initial_post/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The group is going to officially start at the 24th of February 2020, looking already now for bright students! 어서오세요!","type":"post"},{"authors":["C.

Here we report an interfacial engineering approach, where by coating the catalyst with hydrophobic polymers we confine in situ produced O2 gas to tune the water oxidation reaction pathway. Using carbon catalysts as a model system, we show a significant increase of the intrinsic H2O-to-H2O2 selectivity and activity compared to that of the pristine catalyst. The maximal H2O2 Faradaic efficiency was enhanced by sixfold to 66% with an overpotential of 640 mV, under which a H2O2 production rate of 23.4 µmol min−1 cm−2 (75.2 mA cm−2 partial current) was achieved.

Existing methods to do so include extrapolation techniques based on fully explicit treatments of the electrolyte, as well as implicit solvent models which allow for a continuous variation in electrolyte charge. Emerging hybrid continuum models have the potential to revolutionize the field, since they account for the electrolyte with little computational cost while retaining some explicit electrolyte, representing a ``best of both worlds'' method. In this work, we present a unified approach to determine reaction energetics from fully explicit, implicit, and hybrid treatments of the electrolyte based on a new multicapacitor model of the electrochemical interface. A given electrode potential can be achieved by a variety of interfacial structures; a crucial insight from this work is that the effective surface charge gives a good proxy of the local potential, the true driving force of electrochemical processes. In contrast, we show that the traditionally considered work function gives rise to multivalued functions depending on the simulation cell size. Furthermore, we show that the reaction energetics are largely insensitive to the countercharge distribution chosen in hybrid implicit/explicit models, which means that any of the myriad implicit electrolyte models can be equivalently applied. This work thus paves the way for the accurate treatment of ab initio reaction energetics of general surface electrochemical processes using both implicit and explicit electrolytes.","tags":null,"title":"Unified Approach to Implicit and Explicit Solvent Simulations of Electrochemical Reaction Energetics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Recently, the development of hybrid polarizable continuum models/ab initio models have allowed for the treatment of solvation and electrolyte charge in a computationally efficient way. However, challenges remain in its application. Recent literature has reported that large cell heights are required to reach convergence, which presents a serious computational cost. Furthermore, calculations of reaction energetics require costly iterations to tune the surface charge to the desired potential. In this work, we present a simple capacitor model of the interface that illuminates how to circumvent both of these challenges. We derive a correction to the energy for finite cell heights to obtain the large cell energies at no additional computational expense. We furthermore demonstrate that the reaction energetics determined at constant charge are easily mapped to those at constant potential, which eliminates the need to apply iterative schemes to tune the system to a constant potential.

To this end, CO2 reduction was investigated over Ag thin films with (111), (100), and (110) orientations prepared via epitaxial growth on single-crystal Si wafers with the same crystallographic orientations. This preparation technique yielded larger area electrodes than can be achieved using single-crystals, which enabled the electrocatalytic activity of the corresponding Ag surfaces to be quantified in the Tafel regime. The Ag(110) thin films exhibited higher CO evolution activity compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films, consistent with previous single-crystal studies. Density functional theory calculations suggest that CO2 reduction to CO is strongly facet-dependent, and that steps are more active than highly coordinated terraces. This is the result of both a higher binding energy of the key intermediate COOH as well as an enhanced double-layer electric field stabilization over undercoordinated surface atoms located at step edge defects. As a consequence, step edge defects likely dominate the CO2 reduction activity observed over the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films. The higher activity observed over the Ag(110) thin film is then related to the larger density of undercoordinated sites compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films. Our conclusion that undercoordinated sites dominate the CO2 reduction activity observed over close-packed surfaces highlights the need to consider the contribution of such defects in studies of single-crystal electrodes.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of Atomic Surface Structure on the Activity of Ag for the Electrochemical Reduction of CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e to CO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Polarizable continuum models (PCM) have been gaining popularity because they offer a computationally inexpensive method of modeling the electrolyte. In this Perspective, we discuss challenges from using one such model which treats the ions using a linearized Poisson--Boltzmann (LPB) distribution. From a physical perspective, this model places charge unphysically close to the surface and adsorbates, and it includes excessively steep ramping of the dielectric constant from the surface to the bulk solvent. Both of these issues can be somewhat mitigated by adjusting parameters built into the model, but in doing so, the resultant capacitance deviates from experimental values. Likewise, hybrid explicit-implicit approaches to the solvent may offer a more realistic description of hydrogen bonding and solvation to reaction intermediates, but the corresponding capacitances also deviate from experimental values. These deviations highlight the need for a careful adjustment of parameters in order to reproduce not only solvation energies but also other physical properties of solid--liquid interfaces. Continuum approaches alone also necessarily do not capture local variations in the electric field from cations at the interface, which can affect the energetics of intermediates with substantial dipoles or polarizability. Finally, since the double-layer charge can be varied continuously, LPB/PCM models provide a way to determine electrochemical barriers at constant potential. However, double-layer charging and the atomic motion associated with reaction events occur on significantly different timescales. We suggest that more detailed approaches, such as the modified Poisson--Boltzmann model and/or the addition of a Stern layer, may be able to mitigate some but not all of the challenges discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Challenges in Modeling Electrochemical Reaction Energetics with Polarizable Continuum Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

As effective techniques, such implicit solvation models always depend on a number of parameters that need to be determined earlier. In the past, the focus lay mostly on an accurate parametrization of water models. Yet, non-aqueous solvents have recently attracted increasing attention, in particular, for the design of battery materials. To this end, we present a systematic parametrization protocol for the Self-Consistent Continuum Solvation (SCCS) model resulting in optimized parameters for 67 non-aqueous solvents. Our parametrization is based on a collection of $≈$6000 experimentally measured partition coefficients, which we collected in the Solv@TUM database presented here. The accuracy of our optimized SCCS model is comparable to the well-known universal continuum solvation model (SMx) family of methods, while relying on only a single fit parameter and thereby largely reducing statistical noise. Furthermore, slightly modifying the non-electrostatic terms of the model, we present the SCCS-P solvation model as a more accurate alternative, in particular, for aromatic solutes. Finally, we show that SCCS parameters can, to a good degree of accuracy, also be predicted for solvents outside the database using merely the dielectric bulk permittivity of the solvent of choice.","tags":null,"title":"Generalized molecular solvation in non-aqueous solutions by a single parameter implicit solvation scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

We show that the differences in both Tafel slopes and pH dependence for C1 vs C2 activity arise from differences in their multi-step mechanisms. We find the depletion in C2 products observed at high overpotential and high pH to arise from the 2nd order dependence of C-C coupling on CO coverage, which decreases due to competition from the C1 pathway. We further demonstrate that CO(2) reduction at a fixed pH yield similar activities, due to the facile kinetics for CO2 reduction to CO on Cu, which suggests C2 products to be favored for CO2R under alkaline conditions. The mechanistic insights of this work elucidate how reaction conditions can lead to significant enhancements in selectivity and activity towards higher value C2 products.","tags":null,"title":"pH effects on the electrochemical reduction of CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e towards C\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e products on stepped copper","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Given the unique properties that distinguish these systems from traditional transition-metal electrocatalysts, it is essential to benchmark and establish appropriate computational approaches to study these novel materials. Herein, we employ multiple levels of theory, including wave function methods, density functional theory (DFT), and classical simulations, to investigate Cu-modified covalent triazine framework catalysts (Cu/CTF). We consider three major aspects of treating this system computationally. First, we present a step-wise approach to predict the ORR mechanism and adsorbate coverages on Cu/CTF. We then benchmark various DFT methods to coupled-cluster theory with the domain-based local pair natural orbital approximation, which indicates that HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals most accurately describe the adsorption energies of ORR adsorbates on Cu/CTF. We finally employ thermodynamic integration and other techniques to consider solvation effects, which play significant roles in predicting the energies of reaction intermediates and the overall ORR pathway. Our findings indicate that accurate descriptions of both the electronic structure and solvation are necessary to understand the ORR activity of Cu/CTF.","tags":null,"title":"Theoretical Approaches to Describing the Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Single-Atom Catalysts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

For a given salt solution, they require a range of ion-specific parameters, which describe the size of the dissolved ions as well as thickness and shape of the Stern layer. Out of this defined parameter space, we show that the Stern layer thickness expressed in terms of the solute's electron density and the resulting ionic cavity volume completely determine ion effects on the stability of neutral solutes. Using the efficient SMPB functionality of the full-potential density-functional theory package FHI-aims, we derive optimized such Stern layer parameters for neutral solutes in various aqueous monovalent electrolytes. The parametrization protocol relies on fitting to reference Setschenow coefficients that describe solvation free energy changes with ionic strength at low to medium concentrations. The availability of such data for NaCl solutions yields a highly predictive SMPB model that allows to recover the measured Setschenow coefficients with an accuracy that is comparable to prevalent quantitative regression models. Correspondingly derived SMPB parameters for other salts suffer from a much scarcer experimental data base but lead to Stern layer properties that follow a physically reasonable trend with ionic hydration numbers.","tags":null,"title":"Transferable ionic parameters for first-principles Poisson-Boltzmann solvation calculations: Neutral solutes in aqueous monovalent salt solutions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.
