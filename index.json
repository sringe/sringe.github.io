According to these works, the interfacial cation concentration is the main descriptor to explain cation and pH effects. The detailed mechanism (such as e.g. water polarization, water structure changes, field-stabilization of intermediates) depends strongly on potential, pH, oxophilicity of the electrode or the nature of the rate-limiting step and proton donor. With growing convergence in this field, cation effects remain a highly challenging as promising topic for research.","tags":null,"title":"Cation effects on electrocatalytic reduction processes at the example of the hydrogen evolution reaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.H.

However, given its high surface energy, it tends to lose its catalytic activity after an unacceptably short period of usage. The stability of Pt has always been a bottleneck in commercializing the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). In high temperature-polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs), the activity loss has been traced back to the chemisorption of phosphate anions, which irreversibly poison Pt active sites. Herein, we present an alternative Pt phosphide-based (PtP2/C) electrocatalyst for application under high temperature conditions. The prepared PtP2/C catalyst shows surprisingly excellent long-term stability and high catalytic activity in phosphoric acid. From density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found this to be related to the oxyphilicity of the P atoms which under reaction conditions form a protective phosphorus oxide film that also binds phosphoric acid more strongly than Pt sites. Thus-protected Pt sites, in particular those from P defects, are predicted to be highly active for the ORR. The improved stability is also the result of a better oxidation resistance of the carbon support in the presence of PtP2.","tags":null,"title":"Active and stable PtP\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e-based electrocatalysts solve the phosphate poisoning issue of high temperature fuel cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Recently, it has been used as a support material for metal catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion. However, to date, the nature of metal/CeO2 interfaces and their impact on electrochemical processes remains unclear. Here, a Cu-CeO2 nanorod electrochemical CO2 reduction catalyst is presented. Using operando analysis and computational techniques, it is found that, on the application of a reductive electrochemical potential, Cu undergoes an abrupt change in solubility in the ceria matrix converting from less stable randomly dissolved single atomic Cu2+ ions to (Cu0,Cu1+) nanoclusters. Unlike single atomic Cu, which produces C1 products as the main product during electrochemical CO2 reduction, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) clusters lowers the energy barrier for C-C coupling and enables the selective production of C2+ hydrocarbons. As a result, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) in the clusters at the Cu-ceria interface results in a C2+ partial current density/unit Cu weight 27 times that of a corresponding Cu-carbon catalyst under the same conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Tuning the C\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e/C\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e Selectivity of Electrochemical CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e Reduction on Cu-CeO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e Nanorods by Oxidation State Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

A fine example is in the CO2 reduction reaction, of which rate shows a strong dependence on the alkali metal cation (M+) identity, but there is yet to be a unified molecular picture for that. Using quantum-mechanics-based atom-scale simulation, we herein scrutinize the M+-coupling capability to possible intermediates, and establish H+- and M+-associated ET mechanisms for CH4 and CO/C2H4 formations, respectively. These theoretical scenarios are successfully underpinned by Nernstian shifts of polarization curves with the H+ or M+ concentrations and the first-order kinetics of CO/C2H4 formation on the electrode surface charge density. Our finding further rationalizes the merit of using Nafion-coated electrode for enhanced C2 production in terms of enhanced surface charge density.","tags":null,"title":"A unifying mechanism for cation effect modulating C\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e and C\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e productions from CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e electroreduction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

However, shortening charging time of LIBs is limited by Li+ intercalation process consisting of liquid-phase diffusion, de-solvation, SEI crossing, and solid-phase diffusion. Herein, we propose a new strategy to accelerate de-solvation step through control of interaction between polymeric binder and solvent-Li+ complexes. For this purpose, three alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, and K+) substituted carboxymethyl cellulose (Li-, Na-, and K-CMC) are prepared to examine the effects of metal ions on their performance. The lowest activation energy of de-solvation and the highest chemical diffusion coefficient were observed for Li-CMC. Specifically, Li-CMC cell with a capacity of 3 mAh cm-2 could be charged to 95% in 10 min, while a value above 85% was observed after 150 cycles.

We demonstrate that a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface, resulting from more available Cu+ sites, enables high selectivity for methane formation during CO2RR and can be controlled by the calcination temperature. The DFT calculation and in situ Raman studies indicate that pH controls the surface termination; a more alkaline pH generates hydroxylated surface motifs with more active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Using GW-GPE, we have investigated the band edge locations of (quasi) 2D materials immersed in water and found a good agreement with experimental data. We identify two contributions of the solvent effect, termed a ''polarization-field effect'' and an ''environmental screening effect'', which are found to be highly sensitive to the atomic and charge distribution of the 2D materials.

Originating in molecular chemistry with finite solutes, implicit solvation techniques are now increasingly used in the context of first-principles modeling of electrochemistry and electrocatalysis at extended (often metallic) electrodes. The prevalent ansatz to model the latter electrodes and the reactive surface chemistry at them through slabs in periodic boundary condition supercells brings its specific challenges. Foremost this concerns the difficulty of describing the entire double layer forming at the electrified solid-liquid interface (SLI) within supercell sizes tractable by commonly employed density functional theory (DFT). We review liquid solvation methodology from this specific application angle, highlighting in particular its use in the widespread ab initio thermodynamics approach to surface catalysis. Notably, implicit solvation can be employed to mimic a polarization of the electrode's electronic density under the applied potential and the concomitant capacitive charging of the entire double layer beyond the limitations of the employed DFT supercell. Most critical for continuing advances of this effective methodology for the SLI context is the lack of pertinent (experimental or high-level theoretical) reference data needed for parametrization.","tags":null,"title":"Implicit Solvation Methods for Catalysis at Electrified Interfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

For this, we present a new one-dimensional nanowire catalyst consisting of a L10 ordered intermetallic PtCo alloy core and compressively strained high-index facets in the Pt-rich shell. We find the nanoscale PtCo catalyst to provide an excellent turnover for the ORR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which we explain from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations to be due to the high ratio of Pt(221) facets. These facets include highly active ORR and HER sites surprisingly on the terraces which are activated by a combination of sub-surface Co-induced high Miller index-related strain and oxygen coverage on the step sites. The low dimensionality of the catalyst provides a cost-efficient use of Pt. In addition, the high catalytic activity and durability are found during both half-cell and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) operations for both ORR and HER. We believe the revealed design concepts for generating active sites on the Pt-based catalyst can open up a new pathway toward the development of high-performance cathode catalysts for PEMFCs and other catalytic systems.","tags":["HER; PEMFC; density functional theory; high-index facets; intermetallic; nanowire"],"title":"Strained Pt(221) Facet in a PtCo@Pt-Rich Catalyst Boosts Oxygen Reduction and Hydrogen Evolution Activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Ringe","Hafiz Ghulam Abbas","한승창\u003cbr/\u003e Seungchang Han"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1649123569,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649123569,"objectID":"f7131b62f4c1135a4acfd4d5036c61c2","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/project/materialscreening/","publishdate":"2022-04-05T10:52:49+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/materialscreening/","section":"project","summary":"Developing descriptors for electrochemical conversion processes which can be used to initialize high-throughput search for new materials, driven by fast machine learning techniques.","tags":[],"title":"High-throughput computational search for high performance energy materials","type":"project"},{"authors":["Stefan Ringe","Adith Ramakrishnan Velmurugan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1649123569,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649123569,"objectID":"eb7e5d0febcfe5af9343a47226e875f1","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/project/multiscalemodeling/","publishdate":"2022-04-05T10:52:49+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/multiscalemodeling/","section":"project","summary":"Optimizing energy conversion systems at multiple time and size scales, from atomistic to continuum.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-scale modeling","type":"project"},{"authors":["Stefan Ringe","Hafiz Ghulam Abbas","Yevhen Horbatenko","Dianwei Hou","한승창\u003cbr/\u003e Seungchang Han","김서영\u003cbr/\u003e Seoyeong Kim","이세연\u003cbr/\u003e Saeyeon Lee","김동진\u003cbr/\u003e Dongjin Kim","설호성\u003cbr/\u003e Hoseong Seol"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1649123569,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649123569,"objectID":"21659a81989b400467a4aed75cc33e92","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/project/solvationandelectrifiedinterfaces/","publishdate":"2022-04-05T10:52:49+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/solvationandelectrifiedinterfaces/","section":"project","summary":"Employing machine learning techniques for accelerated sampling of liquid molecules phase space to understand the nature of electrified interfaces in energy conversion and storage applications.","tags":[],"title":"Tackling electrified interfaces using density functional theory and machine learning","type":"project"},{"authors":["G.

To date, however, the reaction mechanisms toward the plethora of products are disputed, complicating the search for alternative catalyst materials. To conclusively identify the rate-limiting steps in CO reduction on Cu, we analyzed the mechanisms on the basis of constant-potential density functional theory (DFT) kinetics and experiments at a wide range of pH values (3--13). We find that *CO dimerization is energetically favored as the rate-limiting step toward multicarbon products. This finding is consistent with our experiments, where the reaction rate is nearly unchanged on a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) potential scale, even under acidic conditions. For methane, both theory and experiments indicate a change in the rate-limiting step with electrolyte pH from the first protonation step under acidic/neutral conditions to a later one under alkaline conditions. We also show, through a detailed analysis of the microkinetics, that a surface combination of *CO and *H is inconsistent with the measured current densities and Tafel slopes.

We investigate the effects of cations at the aqueous electrolyte–Cu(211) interface on adsorbate binding energies and the electrolyte structure using density functional theory (DFT). Charging the interface via explicit Na+ has systematic effects on adsorbate–electrolyte interactions and conformations. We describe specific local adsorbate–ion interactions, including direct alkali ion–adsorbate coordination and hydrogen bonding via ion-coordinated water molecules. The relative importance of these specific interactions and purely electrostatic field–adsorbate interactions is investigated by comparing the DFT-calculated ion effects to those predicted by purely electrostatic models of the interface and the adsorbates. We find that the trend in ion effects among different adsorbates at constant surface charge density is well explained by a purely electrostatic interaction model. The binding energy of OCCHO is found to depend strongly on the surface charge density as well as the spatial distribution of ions at constant surface charge density. These effects are also explained by a purely electrostatic local electrostatic field–adsorbate model. This indicates that alkali ion effects can be mainly attributed to purely electrostatic field interactions and that the local field at ion-stabilized active sites can depend significantly on both the overall charge density and on the spatial distribution of ions at constant charge density. This work provides new insight on alkali ion effects on a variety of adsorbates relevant to the CO2 and CO reduction reactions by describing specific local ion–adsorbate interactions, systematic changes in adsorbate–electrolyte interactions induced by explicit surface charge, and comparisons of the calculated effects on binding energies to simple electrostatic field–adsorbate models to explain trends among various adsorbates and at varying surface charge densities and supercell configurations.","tags":null,"title":"Atomistic Insight into Cation Effects on Binding Energies in Cu-Catalyzed Carbon Dioxide Reduction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

Emerging hybrid continuum models have the potential to revolutionize the field, since they account for the electrolyte with little computational cost while retaining some explicit electrolyte, representing a ``best of both worlds'' method. In this work, we present a unified approach to determine reaction energetics from fully explicit, implicit, and hybrid treatments of the electrolyte based on a new multicapacitor model of the electrochemical interface. A given electrode potential can be achieved by a variety of interfacial structures; a crucial insight from this work is that the effective surface charge gives a good proxy of the local potential, the true driving force of electrochemical processes. In contrast, we show that the traditionally considered work function gives rise to multivalued functions depending on the simulation cell size. Furthermore, we show that the reaction energetics are largely insensitive to the countercharge distribution chosen in hybrid implicit/explicit models, which means that any of the myriad implicit electrolyte models can be equivalently applied.

To this end, CO2 reduction was investigated over Ag thin films with (111), (100), and (110) orientations prepared via epitaxial growth on single-crystal Si wafers with the same crystallographic orientations. This preparation technique yielded larger area electrodes than can be achieved using single-crystals, which enabled the electrocatalytic activity of the corresponding Ag surfaces to be quantified in the Tafel regime. The Ag(110) thin films exhibited higher CO evolution activity compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films, consistent with previous single-crystal studies. Density functional theory calculations suggest that CO2 reduction to CO is strongly facet-dependent, and that steps are more active than highly coordinated terraces. This is the result of both a higher binding energy of the key intermediate COOH as well as an enhanced double-layer electric field stabilization over undercoordinated surface atoms located at step edge defects. As a consequence, step edge defects likely dominate the CO2 reduction activity observed over the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films. The higher activity observed over the Ag(110) thin film is then related to the larger density of undercoordinated sites compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films. Our conclusion that undercoordinated sites dominate the CO2 reduction activity observed over close-packed surfaces highlights the need to consider the contribution of such defects in studies of single-crystal electrodes.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of Atomic Surface Structure on the Activity of Ag for the Electrochemical Reduction of CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e to CO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Polarizable continuum models (PCM) have been gaining popularity because they offer a computationally inexpensive method of modeling the electrolyte. In this Perspective, we discuss challenges from using one such model which treats the ions using a linearized Poisson--Boltzmann (LPB) distribution. From a physical perspective, this model places charge unphysically close to the surface and adsorbates, and it includes excessively steep ramping of the dielectric constant from the surface to the bulk solvent. Both of these issues can be somewhat mitigated by adjusting parameters built into the model, but in doing so, the resultant capacitance deviates from experimental values. Likewise, hybrid explicit-implicit approaches to the solvent may offer a more realistic description of hydrogen bonding and solvation to reaction intermediates, but the corresponding capacitances also deviate from experimental values. These deviations highlight the need for a careful adjustment of parameters in order to reproduce not only solvation energies but also other physical properties of solid--liquid interfaces. Continuum approaches alone also necessarily do not capture local variations in the electric field from cations at the interface, which can affect the energetics of intermediates with substantial dipoles or polarizability. Finally, since the double-layer charge can be varied continuously, LPB/PCM models provide a way to determine electrochemical barriers at constant potential. However, double-layer charging and the atomic motion associated with reaction events occur on significantly different timescales. We suggest that more detailed approaches, such as the modified Poisson--Boltzmann model and/or the addition of a Stern layer, may be able to mitigate some but not all of the challenges discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Challenges in Modeling Electrochemical Reaction Energetics with Polarizable Continuum Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Yet, non-aqueous solvents have recently attracted increasing attention, in particular, for the design of battery materials. To this end, we present a systematic parametrization protocol for the Self-Consistent Continuum Solvation (SCCS) model resulting in optimized parameters for 67 non-aqueous solvents.

The accuracy of our optimized SCCS model is comparable to the well-known universal continuum solvation model (SMx) family of methods, while relying on only a single fit parameter and thereby largely reducing statistical noise. Furthermore, slightly modifying the non-electrostatic terms of the model, we present the SCCS-P solvation model as a more accurate alternative, in particular, for aromatic solutes. Finally, we show that SCCS parameters can, to a good degree of accuracy, also be predicted for solvents outside the database using merely the dielectric bulk permittivity of the solvent of choice.","tags":null,"title":"Generalized molecular solvation in non-aqueous solutions by a single parameter implicit solvation scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

The high sensitivity of the calculated activity coefficient on the employed ionic parameters thereby suggests to use extensively tabulated experimental activity coefficients of salt solutions for a systematic parametrization protocol.","tags":null,"title":"Function-Space-Based Solution Scheme for the Size-Modified Poisson-Boltzmann Equation in Full-Potential DFT","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e88ef17c854761dee8732f55d78d7ca5","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/development/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/development/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"665288c8761d48eb3366c37954243edc","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/gallery/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/gallery/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"be40fec02af232829021d97a589ee73c","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/my-publications/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/my-publications/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://ringelab.com/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
