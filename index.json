However, the inherent challenges of nanoscale doping processes, such as the low probability of successful doping, have hindered their practical applications. Nucleation-controlled doping has emerged as a potential solution, but a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of this process is lacking. Herein, the nucleation-controlled doping process facilitated by magic-sized cluster intermediates is elucidated. This approach enables the synthesis of 2D ZnSe quantum nanoribbons with two distinct doping sites. Remarkably, the identity of the dopants plays a critical role in determining the chemical pathways of nucleation-controlled doping. Substitutional doping of magic-sized clusters with Mn2+ ions leads to successful substitutional doping of the final 2D nanocrystals. Conversely, Co2+ ions, initially occupying substitutional positions in the magic-sized cluster intermediates, relocate to alternative sites, such as interstitial sites, in the final nanocrystals. First-principle calculations of dopant formation energies support these experimental findings, demonstrating the thermodynamic favorability of specific dopant site preferences. Moreover, a consistent tendency is observed in CdSe nanocrystals, suggesting that the proposed doping mechanism is generally applicable to II–VI semiconductors. This study will advance the controlled synthesis of various doped semiconductor nanocrystals using nucleation-controlled doping processes.","tags":null,"title":"Nucleation-Controlled Doping of II–VI Semiconductor Nanocrystals Mediated by Magic-Sized Clusters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

In this study, we devised an electrochemical platform to investigate the cellular responses to reactive gaseous molecules. Our designed platform precisely controlled the NO flux and diffusion rates of NO to tumor cells. COMSOL Multiphysics calculations based on diffusion and reaction kinetics were conducted to simulate the behavior of electrochemically generated NO.

In this work, it is found that these established adsorption energy-based descriptor spaces are not applicable to electrochemistry, because they are lacking an important additional dimension, the potential of zero charge. This extra dimension arises from the interaction of the electric double layer with reaction intermediates which does not scale with adsorption energies. At the example of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 it is shown that the addition of this descriptor breaks the scaling relations, opening up a huge chemical space that is readily accessible via potential of zero charge-based material design.

Using operando analysis and computational techniques, it is found that, on the application of a reductive electrochemical potential, Cu undergoes an abrupt change in solubility in the ceria matrix converting from less stable randomly dissolved single atomic Cu2+ ions to (Cu0,Cu1+) nanoclusters. Unlike single atomic Cu, which produces C1 products as the main product during electrochemical CO2 reduction, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) clusters lowers the energy barrier for C-C coupling and enables the selective production of C2+ hydrocarbons. As a result, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) in the clusters at the Cu-ceria interface results in a C2+ partial current density/unit Cu weight 27 times that of a corresponding Cu-carbon catalyst under the same conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Tuning the C\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e/C\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e Selectivity of Electrochemical CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e Reduction on Cu-CeO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e Nanorods by Oxidation State Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.H.

The stability of Pt has always been a bottleneck in commercializing the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). In high temperature-polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs), the activity loss has been traced back to the chemisorption of phosphate anions, which irreversibly poison Pt active sites. Herein, we present an alternative Pt phosphide-based (PtP2/C) electrocatalyst for application under high temperature conditions. The prepared PtP2/C catalyst shows surprisingly excellent long-term stability and high catalytic activity in phosphoric acid. From density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found this to be related to the oxyphilicity of the P atoms which under reaction conditions form a protective phosphorus oxide film that also binds phosphoric acid more strongly than Pt sites. Thus-protected Pt sites, in particular those from P defects, are predicted to be highly active for the ORR. The improved stability is also the result of a better oxidation resistance of the carbon support in the presence of PtP2.","tags":null,"title":"Active and stable PtP\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e-based electrocatalysts solve the phosphate poisoning issue of high temperature fuel cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

We review liquid solvation methodology from this specific application angle, highlighting in particular its use in the widespread ab initio thermodynamics approach to surface catalysis. Notably, implicit solvation can be employed to mimic a polarization of the electrode's electronic density under the applied potential and the concomitant capacitive charging of the entire double layer beyond the limitations of the employed DFT supercell.

In this work, we make a significant step ahead in this direction by preparing a high-performance electrocatalyst and suggesting new structure-activity design concepts which could shape the future of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst design. For this, we present a new one-dimensional nanowire catalyst consisting of a L10 ordered intermetallic PtCo alloy core and compressively strained high-index facets in the Pt-rich shell. We find the nanoscale PtCo catalyst to provide an excellent turnover for the ORR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which we explain from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations to be due to the high ratio of Pt(221) facets. These facets include highly active ORR and HER sites surprisingly on the terraces which are activated by a combination of sub-surface Co-induced high Miller index-related strain and oxygen coverage on the step sites.

To date, however, the reaction mechanisms toward the plethora of products are disputed, complicating the search for alternative catalyst materials. To conclusively identify the rate-limiting steps in CO reduction on Cu, we analyzed the mechanisms on the basis of constant-potential density functional theory (DFT) kinetics and experiments at a wide range of pH values (3--13). We find that *CO dimerization is energetically favored as the rate-limiting step toward multicarbon products. This finding is consistent with our experiments, where the reaction rate is nearly unchanged on a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) potential scale, even under acidic conditions. For methane, both theory and experiments indicate a change in the rate-limiting step with electrolyte pH from the first protonation step under acidic/neutral conditions to a later one under alkaline conditions. We also show, through a detailed analysis of the microkinetics, that a surface combination of *CO and *H is inconsistent with the measured current densities and Tafel slopes.

We investigate the effects of cations at the aqueous electrolyte–Cu(211) interface on adsorbate binding energies and the electrolyte structure using density functional theory (DFT). Charging the interface via explicit Na+ has systematic effects on adsorbate–electrolyte interactions and conformations. We describe specific local adsorbate–ion interactions, including direct alkali ion–adsorbate coordination and hydrogen bonding via ion-coordinated water molecules. The relative importance of these specific interactions and purely electrostatic field–adsorbate interactions is investigated by comparing the DFT-calculated ion effects to those predicted by purely electrostatic models of the interface and the adsorbates. We find that the trend in ion effects among different adsorbates at constant surface charge density is well explained by a purely electrostatic interaction model. The binding energy of OCCHO is found to depend strongly on the surface charge density as well as the spatial distribution of ions at constant surface charge density. These effects are also explained by a purely electrostatic local electrostatic field–adsorbate model. This indicates that alkali ion effects can be mainly attributed to purely electrostatic field interactions and that the local field at ion-stabilized active sites can depend significantly on both the overall charge density and on the spatial distribution of ions at constant charge density. This work provides new insight on alkali ion effects on a variety of adsorbates relevant to the CO2 and CO reduction reactions by describing specific local ion–adsorbate interactions, systematic changes in adsorbate–electrolyte interactions induced by explicit surface charge, and comparisons of the calculated effects on binding energies to simple electrostatic field–adsorbate models to explain trends among various adsorbates and at varying surface charge densities and supercell configurations.","tags":null,"title":"Atomistic Insight into Cation Effects on Binding Energies in Cu-Catalyzed Carbon Dioxide Reduction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

In this work, Ni(II) phthalocyanine molecules grafted on carbon nanotube (NiPc/CNT) and heat-treated NiPc/CNT (H-NiPc/CNT) are exploited as model catalysts to investigate the impact of thermal activation on the structure of active site and CO2RR activity. H-NiPc/CNT exhibits ~4.7-fold higher turnover frequency for CO2RR to CO in comparison to NiPc/CNT. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the heat treatment transforms molecular Ni2+–N4 sites of NiPc into Ni+–N3V (V: vacancy) and Ni+–N3 sites incorporated in the graphene lattice that concomitantly involves a breakage of Ni–N bonding, shrinkage in the Ni–N–C local structure, and decrease in the oxidation state of the Ni center from +2 to +1. DFT calculations combined with micro-kinetic modeling suggest that the Ni–N3V site appears to be responsible for the high CO2RR activity because of its lower barrier for the formation of *COOH intermediate and optimum *CO binding energy.

Emerging hybrid continuum models have the potential to revolutionize the field, since they account for the electrolyte with little computational cost while retaining some explicit electrolyte, representing a ``best of both worlds'' method. In this work, we present a unified approach to determine reaction energetics from fully explicit, implicit, and hybrid treatments of the electrolyte based on a new multicapacitor model of the electrochemical interface. A given electrode potential can be achieved by a variety of interfacial structures; a crucial insight from this work is that the effective surface charge gives a good proxy of the local potential, the true driving force of electrochemical processes. In contrast, we show that the traditionally considered work function gives rise to multivalued functions depending on the simulation cell size. Furthermore, we show that the reaction energetics are largely insensitive to the countercharge distribution chosen in hybrid implicit/explicit models, which means that any of the myriad implicit electrolyte models can be equivalently applied. This work thus paves the way for the accurate treatment of ab initio reaction energetics of general surface electrochemical processes using both implicit and explicit electrolytes.","tags":null,"title":"Unified Approach to Implicit and Explicit Solvent Simulations of Electrochemical Reaction Energetics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

In this work, we present a simple capacitor model of the interface that illuminates how to circumvent both of these challenges. We derive a correction to the energy for finite cell heights to obtain the large cell energies at no additional computational expense. We furthermore demonstrate that the reaction energetics determined at constant charge are easily mapped to those at constant potential, which eliminates the need to apply iterative schemes to tune the system to a constant potential. These developments together represent more than an order of magnitude reduction of the computational overhead required for the application of polarizable continuum models to surface electrochemistry.","tags":null,"title":"Practical Considerations for Continuum Models Applied to Surface Electrochemistry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

To this end, CO2 reduction was investigated over Ag thin films with (111), (100), and (110) orientations prepared via epitaxial growth on single-crystal Si wafers with the same crystallographic orientations. This preparation technique yielded larger area electrodes than can be achieved using single-crystals, which enabled the electrocatalytic activity of the corresponding Ag surfaces to be quantified in the Tafel regime. The Ag(110) thin films exhibited higher CO evolution activity compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films, consistent with previous single-crystal studies. Density functional theory calculations suggest that CO2 reduction to CO is strongly facet-dependent, and that steps are more active than highly coordinated terraces. This is the result of both a higher binding energy of the key intermediate COOH as well as an enhanced double-layer electric field stabilization over undercoordinated surface atoms located at step edge defects. As a consequence, step edge defects likely dominate the CO2 reduction activity observed over the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films. The higher activity observed over the Ag(110) thin film is then related to the larger density of undercoordinated sites compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films. Our conclusion that undercoordinated sites dominate the CO2 reduction activity observed over close-packed surfaces highlights the need to consider the contribution of such defects in studies of single-crystal electrodes.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of Atomic Surface Structure on the Activity of Ag for the Electrochemical Reduction of CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e to CO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Polarizable continuum models (PCM) have been gaining popularity because they offer a computationally inexpensive method of modeling the electrolyte. In this Perspective, we discuss challenges from using one such model which treats the ions using a linearized Poisson--Boltzmann (LPB) distribution. From a physical perspective, this model places charge unphysically close to the surface and adsorbates, and it includes excessively steep ramping of the dielectric constant from the surface to the bulk solvent. Both of these issues can be somewhat mitigated by adjusting parameters built into the model, but in doing so, the resultant capacitance deviates from experimental values. Likewise, hybrid explicit-implicit approaches to the solvent may offer a more realistic description of hydrogen bonding and solvation to reaction intermediates, but the corresponding capacitances also deviate from experimental values. These deviations highlight the need for a careful adjustment of parameters in order to reproduce not only solvation energies but also other physical properties of solid--liquid interfaces. Continuum approaches alone also necessarily do not capture local variations in the electric field from cations at the interface, which can affect the energetics of intermediates with substantial dipoles or polarizability. Finally, since the double-layer charge can be varied continuously, LPB/PCM models provide a way to determine electrochemical barriers at constant potential. However, double-layer charging and the atomic motion associated with reaction events occur on significantly different timescales. We suggest that more detailed approaches, such as the modified Poisson--Boltzmann model and/or the addition of a Stern layer, may be able to mitigate some but not all of the challenges discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Challenges in Modeling Electrochemical Reaction Energetics with Polarizable Continuum Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

As effective techniques, such implicit solvation models always depend on a number of parameters that need to be determined earlier. In the past, the focus lay mostly on an accurate parametrization of water models. Yet, non-aqueous solvents have recently attracted increasing attention, in particular, for the design of battery materials. To this end, we present a systematic parametrization protocol for the Self-Consistent Continuum Solvation (SCCS) model resulting in optimized parameters for 67 non-aqueous solvents. Our parametrization is based on a collection of $≈$6000 experimentally measured partition coefficients, which we collected in the Solv@TUM database presented here. The accuracy of our optimized SCCS model is comparable to the well-known universal continuum solvation model (SMx) family of methods, while relying on only a single fit parameter and thereby largely reducing statistical noise. Furthermore, slightly modifying the non-electrostatic terms of the model, we present the SCCS-P solvation model as a more accurate alternative, in particular, for aromatic solutes. Finally, we show that SCCS parameters can, to a good degree of accuracy, also be predicted for solvents outside the database using merely the dielectric bulk permittivity of the solvent of choice.","tags":null,"title":"Generalized molecular solvation in non-aqueous solutions by a single parameter implicit solvation scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

We find the depletion in C2 products observed at high overpotential and high pH to arise from the 2nd order dependence of C-C coupling on CO coverage, which decreases due to competition from the C1 pathway. We further demonstrate that CO(2) reduction at a fixed pH yield similar activities, due to the facile kinetics for CO2 reduction to CO on Cu, which suggests C2 products to be favored for CO2R under alkaline conditions.
