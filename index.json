Understanding electrochemistry requires a detailed modeling of electrochemical reaction kinetics, but also mass transport, both under applied bias potential. Porous electrodes give rise to particularly interesting mass transport phenomena, which interplay with reaction kinetics is only little understood.  For a long time, planar, crystalline electrodes have been predominantly used to catalyze energy conversion processes. The simplicity of these systems enabled DFT simulations to unravel binding energy descriptors for electrocatalytic activity and develop efficient catalyst screening approaches. However, the intrinsic limitations of electrode engineering in two dimensions has triggered developments towards the use of 3D-structured electrodes. Nowadays, in particular the use of porous electrodes, enables to selectively design the arrangement, strain, environment and volume density of active sites and maximize the mass-loading based activity of expensive catalysts. Porous electrodes are thus a state-of-the-art means for many electrochemical reactions, such as ORR, HER and OER. Particularly strong effects have been found for CO2 and CO reduction, with critical enhancements of valuable C2+ (carbohydrates and alcohols at least two carbon atoms) product formation on copper, and CO formation on gold and silver. Despite the significance of these effects in a wide range of energy conversion processes, the physical complexity of the systems has largely limited a detailed understanding and strategic design of porous electrodes. The goal of this project is to develop a my group will be to develop a cutting edge multi-scale framework for modeling electrochemical energy conversion in nano-structured electrodes. Ultimately, this leads to generalized design principles that take both mass transport and reaction kinetics into account. The CatINT software which is under continuous development enables to achieve this task.\nRelated work from our group\n ringe-2019-dm\n","date":1581558769,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581558769,"objectID":"1f26d1e4ce90e5e9e252cb9ff9df5aa4","permalink":"https://sringe.github.io/project/multiscaledesign/","publishdate":"2020-02-13T10:52:49+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/multiscaledesign/","section":"project","summary":"Electrochemical energy conversion processes are intrinsically multi-scale, reaching from reaction events at atomic size scales to mass transport processes at micro-meter scales.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-scale electrochemical system design","type":"project"},{"authors":["Stefan Ringe"],"categories":[],"content":"Research interest and motivation   Our research focuses on machine learning assisted, first-principles and in operando design of energy conversion (electrolyzers, fuel cells), energy harvesting (solar cells) and energy storage (batteries) materials.  Our world today is facing an unprecedented environmental challenge, with the energy demand steadily increasing, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere reaching record-high levels in the human history, and oil, gas and coal being estimated to last for around 50\u0026ndash;100 years. The already initiated global drive towards renewable energies is limited by an efficient and carbon-neutral conversion and storage of electrical and chemical energy. A central role is played by the electrochemical reduction of the greenhouse CO2 gas (CO2R), which offers an environmentally highly valuable route to fuels, but is still not economically feasible due to catalysts exhibiting high overpotentials and poor product selectivity. At the same time, hydrogen gas, which is essential for the chemical industry, is almost exclusively harvested via carbon-intensive steam reforming. The sustainable alternative, electrochemical water splitting, is again limited by high overpotentials making the process economically intractable. The recent environmental changes have, however, increased the political and economic momentum towards carbon-neutral harvesting and conversion of energy.\nThe main focus of our research group is the computational discovery of economically competitive energy conversion and storage systems, comprising solar cells, batteries, capacitors, fuel cells and electrolyzers. The central challenge is to develop a much more directed and systematic material screening framework based on detailed physical and chemical understanding of the processes and their reaction environment. In particular in the field of electrocatalysis, the discovery of increasingly more complex, nano-structured and multi-component active catalysts has significantly decreased scientific comprehension and lead to a critically high level of experience- and trial-and-error-based search for new materials.

Emerging hybrid continuum models have the potential to revolutionize the field, since they account for the electrolyte with little computational cost while retaining some explicit electrolyte, representing a ``best of both worlds'' method. In this work, we present a unified approach to determine reaction energetics from fully explicit, implicit, and hybrid treatments of the electrolyte based on a new multicapacitor model of the electrochemical interface. A given electrode potential can be achieved by a variety of interfacial structures; a crucial insight from this work is that the effective surface charge gives a good proxy of the local potential, the true driving force of electrochemical processes. In contrast, we show that the traditionally considered work function gives rise to multivalued functions depending on the simulation cell size. Furthermore, we show that the reaction energetics are largely insensitive to the countercharge distribution chosen in hybrid implicit/explicit models, which means that any of the myriad implicit electrolyte models can be equivalently applied. This work thus paves the way for the accurate treatment of ab initio reaction energetics of general surface electrochemical processes using both implicit and explicit electrolytes.","tags":null,"title":"Unified Approach to Implicit and Explicit Solvent Simulations of Electrochemical Reaction Energetics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

To this end, CO2 reduction was investigated over Ag thin films with (111), (100), and (110) orientations prepared via epitaxial growth on single-crystal Si wafers with the same crystallographic orientations. This preparation technique yielded larger area electrodes than can be achieved using single-crystals, which enabled the electrocatalytic activity of the corresponding Ag surfaces to be quantified in the Tafel regime. The Ag(110) thin films exhibited higher CO evolution activity compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films, consistent with previous single-crystal studies. Density functional theory calculations suggest that CO2 reduction to CO is strongly facet-dependent, and that steps are more active than highly coordinated terraces. This is the result of both a higher binding energy of the key intermediate COOH as well as an enhanced double-layer electric field stabilization over undercoordinated surface atoms located at step edge defects. As a consequence, step edge defects likely dominate the CO2 reduction activity observed over the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films. The higher activity observed over the Ag(110) thin film is then related to the larger density of undercoordinated sites compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films.

Polarizable continuum models (PCM) have been gaining popularity because they offer a computationally inexpensive method of modeling the electrolyte. In this Perspective, we discuss challenges from using one such model which treats the ions using a linearized Poisson--Boltzmann (LPB) distribution. From a physical perspective, this model places charge unphysically close to the surface and adsorbates, and it includes excessively steep ramping of the dielectric constant from the surface to the bulk solvent. Both of these issues can be somewhat mitigated by adjusting parameters built into the model, but in doing so, the resultant capacitance deviates from experimental values. Likewise, hybrid explicit-implicit approaches to the solvent may offer a more realistic description of hydrogen bonding and solvation to reaction intermediates, but the corresponding capacitances also deviate from experimental values. These deviations highlight the need for a careful adjustment of parameters in order to reproduce not only solvation energies but also other physical properties of solid--liquid interfaces. Continuum approaches alone also necessarily do not capture local variations in the electric field from cations at the interface, which can affect the energetics of intermediates with substantial dipoles or polarizability. Finally, since the double-layer charge can be varied continuously, LPB/PCM models provide a way to determine electrochemical barriers at constant potential. However, double-layer charging and the atomic motion associated with reaction events occur on significantly different timescales. We suggest that more detailed approaches, such as the modified Poisson--Boltzmann model and/or the addition of a Stern layer, may be able to mitigate some but not all of the challenges discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Challenges in Modeling Electrochemical Reaction Energetics with Polarizable Continuum Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

As effective techniques, such implicit solvation models always depend on a number of parameters that need to be determined earlier. In the past, the focus lay mostly on an accurate parametrization of water models. Yet, non-aqueous solvents have recently attracted increasing attention, in particular, for the design of battery materials. To this end, we present a systematic parametrization protocol for the Self-Consistent Continuum Solvation (SCCS) model resulting in optimized parameters for 67 non-aqueous solvents. Our parametrization is based on a collection of $≈$6000 experimentally measured partition coefficients, which we collected in the Solv@TUM database presented here. The accuracy of our optimized SCCS model is comparable to the well-known universal continuum solvation model (SMx) family of methods, while relying on only a single fit parameter and thereby largely reducing statistical noise. Furthermore, slightly modifying the non-electrostatic terms of the model, we present the SCCS-P solvation model as a more accurate alternative, in particular, for aromatic solutes. Finally, we show that SCCS parameters can, to a good degree of accuracy, also be predicted for solvents outside the database using merely the dielectric bulk permittivity of the solvent of choice.","tags":null,"title":"Generalized molecular solvation in non-aqueous solutions by a single parameter implicit solvation scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://sringe.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Landing Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://sringe.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Landing Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"23d1e75f872528fc12f5f2b142375ff7","permalink":"https://sringe.github.io/publications/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Landing Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://sringe.github.io/research/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Landing Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["X.

We show that the differences in both Tafel slopes and pH dependence for C1 vs C2 activity arise from differences in their multi-step mechanisms. We find the depletion in C2 products observed at high overpotential and high pH to arise from the 2nd order dependence of C-C coupling on CO coverage, which decreases due to competition from the C1 pathway. We further demonstrate that CO(2) reduction at a fixed pH yield similar activities, due to the facile kinetics for CO2 reduction to CO on Cu, which suggests C2 products to be favored for CO2R under alkaline conditions. The mechanistic insights of this work elucidate how reaction conditions can lead to significant enhancements in selectivity and activity towards higher value C2 products.","tags":null,"title":"pH effects on the electrochemical reduction of CO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e towards C\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e products on stepped copper","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Given the unique properties that distinguish these systems from traditional transition-metal electrocatalysts, it is essential to benchmark and establish appropriate computational approaches to study these novel materials. Herein, we employ multiple levels of theory, including wave function methods, density functional theory (DFT), and classical simulations, to investigate Cu-modified covalent triazine framework catalysts (Cu/CTF). We consider three major aspects of treating this system computationally. First, we present a step-wise approach to predict the ORR mechanism and adsorbate coverages on Cu/CTF. We then benchmark various DFT methods to coupled-cluster theory with the domain-based local pair natural orbital approximation, which indicates that HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals most accurately describe the adsorption energies of ORR adsorbates on Cu/CTF. We finally employ thermodynamic integration and other techniques to consider solvation effects, which play significant roles in predicting the energies of reaction intermediates and the overall ORR pathway. Our findings indicate that accurate descriptions of both the electronic structure and solvation are necessary to understand the ORR activity of Cu/CTF.","tags":null,"title":"Theoretical Approaches to Describing the Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Single-Atom Catalysts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

For a given salt solution, they require a range of ion-specific parameters, which describe the size of the dissolved ions as well as thickness and shape of the Stern layer. Out of this defined parameter space, we show that the Stern layer thickness expressed in terms of the solute's electron density and the resulting ionic cavity volume completely determine ion effects on the stability of neutral solutes. Using the efficient SMPB functionality of the full-potential density-functional theory package FHI-aims, we derive optimized such Stern layer parameters for neutral solutes in various aqueous monovalent electrolytes. The parametrization protocol relies on fitting to reference Setschenow coefficients that describe solvation free energy changes with ionic strength at low to medium concentrations. The availability of such data for NaCl solutions yields a highly predictive SMPB model that allows to recover the measured Setschenow coefficients with an accuracy that is comparable to prevalent quantitative regression models. Correspondingly derived SMPB parameters for other salts suffer from a much scarcer experimental data base but lead to Stern layer properties that follow a physically reasonable trend with ionic hydration numbers.","tags":null,"title":"Transferable ionic parameters for first-principles Poisson-Boltzmann solvation calculations: Neutral solutes in aqueous monovalent salt solutions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

It combines an account of the dielectric solvent response with a mean-field description of solvated finite-sized ions. We present a general solution scheme for the MPB equation based on a fast function-space-oriented Newton method and a Green's function preconditioned iterative linear solver. In contrast to popular multigrid solvers, this approach allows us to fully exploit specialized integration grids and optimized integration schemes. We describe a corresponding numerically efficient implementation for the full-potential density-functional theory (DFT) code FHI-aims. We show that together with an additional Stern layer correction the DFT+MPB approach can describe the mean activity coefficient of a KCl aqueous solution over a wide range of concentrations. The high sensitivity of the calculated activity coefficient on the employed ionic parameters thereby suggests to use extensively tabulated experimental activity coefficients of salt solutions for a systematic parametrization protocol.","tags":null,"title":"Function-Space-Based Solution Scheme for the Size-Modified Poisson-Boltzmann Equation in Full-Potential DFT","type":"publication"}]
